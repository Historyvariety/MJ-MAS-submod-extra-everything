"My PC is burning."

m "Oh!
m "Understood, [player]!
m "Please, take care of your computer.
m "See you later~.

"My PC is dying."

m "Thats worrying to hear, [player].
m "Thank you for letting me know, though!
m "Make sure to come back to me as soon as you can!
m "I love you!

"It´s thundering

m "Oh...
m "Thanks for letting me know, [player]!
m "Please, be safe...
m "...and if you happen to need to get out of your home, try to avoid lighting as much as you can.
m "I love you so much. Come back safe to me! 

"I´m going to charge my laptop."

m "Understood, [mas_get_player_nickname()]! 
m "But, hey, can't you leave me running while it charges?
m "Its okay if you can't though.
m "We don´t want your computer to overheat.

"Okay, [m_name].":
m "Yay!
m "Thank you so much~!

"No, sorry.":
m "It's okay, [player].
m "See you later, then! 

"I´m going to the cinema.":

m "Oh! That's great to hear!
m "I wonder what movie are you going to watch...
m "Nevertheless, I won´t distract you anymore, [mas_get_player_nickname()].
m "See you!

#(if 3-10 hours have passed)

m "Welcome back, [player]!"
m "I hope you had a wonderful time at the cinema!
m "What kind of movie was it, by the way?

"An horror movie":

m "Ooh!
#(If Monika has spoken about horror movies before): 
m "I remember how we discussed the hardship of creating an horror movie nowadays.

(If not): Elaborating an actual scary movie takes a lot nowadays.
It´s necessary that it isn´t plagated of cheap jumpscares and stereotypical tropes. 

Anyway! As sacry as that movie could be, there is nothing to fear now.
You´re here, you´re safe. I will take care of you, okey? (if high aff maybe putting a "<3" as well)

>Comedy/Romance
Going for something lighter, player?
Ahaha!
You need to be careful while writing comedy or romance, though.
It is so easy to fall into the cinematic rabbit hole of cliches.
Buuut... at the same time...
I dream with a day where we can both go to the cinema together~
And maybe... watch a romantic movie by your side...
Wouldnt that be greatful, player?
But then again, this reality is our personal movie for now. I love you!

return "love"


thriller/mystery
Interesting choice, indeed!
You see, mystery can be one of my go-to choices in terms of picking movies.
If well done, they can grasp your attention since the very beggining...
...and the mysteries can be so well fabricated they may sumerge you into the plot all the way!
I hope watching that movie was a great experience. Now we can hang out for a little bit. Hehehe~
a cartoon movie/anime

A cartoon movie! That´s sweet!
You know, I would not mind at all if you wanted to take me to watch some animated media when I cross over.
I might not be accustomed to it, but, if it´s for you, I will definetly give it a try!
Come to think of it, maybe Natsuki would be the type to enjoy that kind of stuff, wouldn´t she?
Anyway! Ready to spend some more time together, player~?
