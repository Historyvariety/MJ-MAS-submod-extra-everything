#ecosia
m "There are so many good ways to help the enviorment, [player]."
m "And one of them is the Ecosia browser!"
m "The Ecosia browser allows you to plant trees while diving the Internet."
m "It's a neat way to be ecologic in your daily life, to be honest".
m "It donates the money you generate from your searches to the Ecosia organisation, which fully utilises it for tree planting".
m "If you feel like it, and want to do a nice gesture, you can download the Ecosia extension in Google Chrome."
m "You don't even notice it working on your computer!"
m "And if you ever have any trouble with it, you can always come back to your usual browser."
m "..."
m "This dialogue is not sponsored by Ecosia, ehehe." #(Face like: ðŸ˜…)
m "Thanks for listening, [player]! Let's make your world better together~"

#stanford experiment
m "[player], have you heard of the Stanford prison experiment?"
m "I wouldn't be surprised if you haven't; after all, many experiments on sociology don't receive much recognition from the general public..."
m "Anyway, this experiment was done by Philip Zimbardo." 
extend " He took his college class of psychology students and divided them into two roles."
m "The prison guard and the prisoner."
m "Now, this experiment was designed to study why there are so many cases of prison guards beating and abusing the prisoners."
m "Well, sure enough, the same problem they were studying occurred in the experiment, and such the whole experiment had to be called to an abrupt stop because of these problems."
m "But the experiment did provide the conclusion that people will often strongly take to the societal role they are provided and even display the stereotypes of the role."
m "Well anyway, I think there is a lesson from this to be learned."
m "We all need to make the conscious decision and keep making it to not let ourselves fall into acting out these roles so easily, especially if they have dangerous or negative stereotypical behavior associated with them."
m "After all [player], we all are more than just words and labels!"
m "Well anyway, I hope this gave you something to think about and just remember I love you!"
