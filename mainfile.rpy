m "There are so many good ways to help the enviorment, [player]."
m "And one of them is the Ecosia browser!"
m "The Ecosia browser allows you to plant trees while diving the Internet."
m "It's a neat way to be ecologic in your daily life, to be honest".
m "It donates the money you generate from your searches to the Ecosia organisation, which fully utilises it for tree planting".
m "If you feel like it, and want to do a nice gesture, you can download the Ecosia extension in Google Chrome."
m "You don't even notice it working on your computer!"
m "And if you ever have any trouble with it, you can always come back to your usual browser."
m "..."
m "This dialogue is not sponsored by Ecosia, ehehe." (Face like: ðŸ˜…)
m "Thanks for listening, [player]! Let's make your world better together~"
